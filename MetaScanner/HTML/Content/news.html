                <p><h7><em>This post is part of an ongoing series discussing MetaGeek&#8217;s new packet visualizer, Eye P.A.<br />
See our previous post: <a href="http://www.metageek.net/blog/2012/01/accelerate_your_pcap_skills_with_visual_packet_analysis/">Get ready to accelerate your .pcap skills with Visual Packet Analysis</a></em></h7></p>
<p>Right now, packet analysis works like a search engine. You enter a search term and it returns several thousand packets that meet the query. This works great when you know exactly what you&#8217;re looking for. <br />If you don&#8217;t &#8211; get ready to spend some time with your old friend, Mr. Scrollwheel.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been-there-done-that, I&#8217;d like to introduce you to Eye P.A.&#8230; <a href="http://www.metageek.net/blog/2012/01/modern_packet_analysis_is_getting_a_visual_overhaul/" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>

                <p>Have you ever opened a packet capture file in WireShark?  The .pcap (short for Packet Capture) is the most ubiquitous file format for logging network traffic and can be used by almost any network analysis tool.  It also displays huge amounts of data that you have to scroll through to find problems with your network.</p>
<p>Packet capture analysis is an essential piece of successful wireless networking.  If you haven’t drilled down to the packet level to find a rogue AP, identify the top talkers, count retransmits or understand the % of network bandwidth traveling between bytes, packets or time &#8211; you’ll find that there are a lot of ways to export wireless data into a handy .pcap file.&#8230; <a href="http://www.metageek.net/blog/2012/01/accelerate_your_pcap_skills_with_visual_packet_analysis/" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>

                <p>When Wi-Fi was invented and subsequently adopted en-masse, it brought a wave of mobile computing (think laptops).  Corporations, universities, hospitals, and everyone else started putting in APs like crazy.  Wi-Fi use exploded in the residential space too. Then, Wi-Fi chipsets started showing up in smartphones, iPods, digital cameras and a multitude of other gadgets.  This has magnified the usefulness of WLANs and got all of of us *seriously* addicted to Wi-Fi.  In fact, it’s hard to remember what we did before we had this ubiquitous wireless connection. </p>
<p>Now, with the quickly emerging concept of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">The Internet of Things</a>”, we are likely to see another big leap forward in Wi-Fi usage &#8211; connecting &#8220;things&#8221; (such as HVAC systems and refrigerators) to 802.11.&#8230; <a href="http://www.metageek.net/blog/2011/12/the-internet-of-things/" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>

                <p><strong>February 2010:</strong> MetaGeek moved into a new office, twice the size of our previous space.  We had a large conference room for staff meetings, a small conference room for calls, a big reception area, and plenty of space for our employees. Plus, it had an extra garage/warehouse section that added an additional 1500 sq ft. We figured we’d be able to stay put for at least three years.</p>
<p>As the days passed, we had to move the large conference room from inside the office into the garage space, along with shipping and inventory, in order to make room for more employees.&#8230; <a href="http://www.metageek.net/blog/2011/11/the-evolution-of-the-geeks/" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>

                <p>As part of the second annual <a href="http://www.boisebotcompetition.org">Boise Bot Competition</a>, the Idaho-based <a href="http://www.scidaho.org/">Discovery Center</a> also hosted a Tech Fest which offers local companies an opportunity to talk about problems they are solving with technology and more importantly &#8211; how it works. Being the geeks we are, we jumped at the opportunity to participate. Saturday morning Chris, one of our software hackers, and I headed off to join in the fun.</p>
<p>The MetaGeek demonstration table was right inside the entrance to the Discovery Center. We had <a href="http://www.metageek.net/products/chanalyzer/">Chanalyzer</a> running on a variety of different devices, including a MacBook Pro, Windows virtual machine, <br />a Windows 8 tablet PC, an Android tablet, and an iPad.&#8230; <a href="http://www.metageek.net/blog/2011/10/metageek-at-boise-bot-competition/" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>

Year after year, a few of our friends in automation and A/V encouraged us to exhibit at <a href="http://www.cedia.net/expo/index2011.php">CEDIA (Custom Electronic Design and Installation Association)</a>. We decided to take their advice to get a booth at the 2011 Expo &#8211; and had a great experience!&#8230; <a href="http://www.metageek.net/blog/2011/09/automation-and-av-installers-need-metageek/" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>

                <p>It took us two years but we finally gave the Mac version of Chanalyzer some love. Chanalyzer for Mac now supports the latest models of Wi-Spy 2.4x, DBx and 900x and boy, does it look beautiful on one of these slim silvery macbooks!</p>
<p><strong>What’s New?</strong></p>
<p>MetaGeek updated the color schemes to support Color by Density, Color by Amplitude and Color by Utilization. We really like the color by utilization and we think it will help you determine the best Wi-Fi channels for you ipad-ready WLAN.</p>
